# Starcraft 2 Player Analysis

# Project Overview

Over 300,000 people play Starcraft 2 on a monthly basis and a smaller population of professionals compete in tournaments, with single tournament prize pools weighing in at $700,000 (WCS 2017 Global Finals). Much like chess, clear gaps in skill exist among the population. As an aside, the Esports industry took in a whopping $1.5 billion in 2017 and is on pace to grow an additional 26% by 2020, according to a report generated by SuperData (https://www.superdataresearch.com/market-data/esports-market-report/). Starcraft is a longstanding title and has played a significant role in the competitive esports scene, with its' popularity in South Korea fueling the growth of Esports as a whole. Activision-Blizzard's space-themed real time strategy game is enjoyable to play and like chess, has a wide range of player skills within the population. With professionals earning several hundered thousand dollars each year through live streaming and tournament prize money, there undoubtedly exists full-time committment incentives. But what exactly separates the pros from the noobs? The analysis I conducted here seeks to answer that question.
